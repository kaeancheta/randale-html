                At one point in his life, Randale was shorter than 5'0". Now, Randale is taller than 5'0". He does not like or eat vegetables, therefore he is weak. Randale prefers to eat meat and drink soda. All the unhealthy stuff. Despite these eating habits, he remains fairly healthy due to him being forced to participate in physical activity.
